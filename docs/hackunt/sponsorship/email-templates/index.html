<p>We should follow up with sponsors after our event. It is important to know what we did right and did wrong. This will better help us to understand the wants and needs of our sponsors. These companies were willing to give us a chance and give us a considerable amount. It is important that we try to mitigate all damages that might have occurred during the event. This way sponsors will feel appreciated and sponsored again in the future.</p>

  Sponsorship Onboarding
  <a class="anchor" href="#sponsorship-onboarding">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Sponsorship Onboarding is the next step after sponsors agree to participate in the hackathon!</p>
<p>It is very important that you follow up quickly and respectively during these times.</p>
<p>Sponsors will have quite a few questions but most can be answered by giving them the Sponsor Onboarding Packet.</p>

<p><em>This is an example of a follow-up email after I made a connection at OMG. Do with it as you will but keep in mind that your sponsorship packet should be added to this email as well. Since OMG has never been a member of our hackathon before this was a great way to pull them in.</em></p>
<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>Happy Monday Charis, </p>
<p>Thank you for responding back to me. I have attached our sponsorship packet to this email to make it a bit easier to see our options. We are not in a big rush but we would like to know before April 1st so we can finalize booths, and meeting times. </p>
<p>If you all do not see something in the sponsorship that does not fit all of your needs / wants we are willing to make adjustments as needed. </p>
<p>We will have all types of students attending the event as well. So OMG will have an opportunity to see students from all types of majors as well. We will have showcases at our event from some of our other organizations on Campus as well ( Fingers Crossed all goes well and we get to shoot off a rocket! ) </p>
<p>If you have any questions please let me know I would be happy to help.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
