<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>My name is Leslie Cruz.
I am reaching out on behalf of HackUNT 2023.</p>
<p>We are a student organization running a competitive coding competition at the University of North Texas and are looking for sponsorship for our event.</p>
<p>HackUNT is a student-run, non-profit event striving to bring together students of all backgrounds to innovate and solve real-world problems. Within 24 hours, talented students from all over the country come together at HackUNT to strengthen their leadership skills, work and grow in a team, and develop real-world solutions for industry leaders like yourself. HackUNT 2023 is the sixth annual UNT hackathon.</p>
<p>Your support as a sponsor for HackUNT will help every aspect of the event. Contributions from sponsors go towards the costs of the venue, food, t-shirts, staffing, and many, many other things that make a hackathon successful and exciting.</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hello Sebastian,</p>
<p>I am your sponsorship coordinator for HackUNT 2023. We were very pleased to have RESPEC as a sponsor for HackUNT for the past two years and hope to have the chance to work with you again. The event will be held February 4-5, 2023 and we would be thrilled to have RESPEC involved. As a legacy sponsor, we’re reaching out to you to ensure you get priority to sponsor the event.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating this year, I&rsquo;ve attached the sponsorship information packet. We were very impressed with the agility and imagination of the projects last year and are hoping for an even larger and more impressive turnout this year! Additionally, we are grateful to have RESPEC as a sponsor, and your experience is very important to us. Please reach out if any additional/niche benefits can be added to your package to meet your needs as a sponsor.</p>
<p>Thank you and we look forward to working with you,</p>

<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>Happy Monday Charis,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding back to me. I have attached our sponsorship packet to this email to make it a bit easier to see our options. We are not in a big rush but we would like to know before April 1st so we can finalize booths, and meeting times.</p>
<p>If you all do not see something in the sponsorship that does not fit all of your needs / wants, we are willing to make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p>We will have all types of students attending the event as well. So OMG will have an opportunity to see students from all types of majors as well. We will have showcases at our event from some of our other organizations on campus as well ( fingers crossed all goes well and we get to shoot off a rocket! )</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please let me know. I would be happy to help.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
